DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THE ART IN THIS PROJECT OR MAKE MONEY OFF THE ARTISTIC ASSETS IN ANY WAY. **THE "Store" page doesn't actually allow you to purchase anything.**

This is a HTML, CSS, and Javascript project I made during univeristy for my Web Design class. It has three seperate pages, each simualting a front landing page, a stock page, and a purchase page. The three icons on the top right are hyperlinks that allow you to load the other pages.

Here is the Landing Page:
